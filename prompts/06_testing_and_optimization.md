# Testing and Optimization Prompt

## How to Use This Prompt
When implementing testing and optimization strategies, provide this prompt to your AI assistant along with specific details about your application's performance requirements and pain points. Describe any specific concerns about API costs, response times, or reliability issues you'd like to address. Example: "I need to optimize my deep research tool for cost efficiency while maintaining accurate results, and I'm particularly concerned about OpenAI API token usage."


## Context
As of June 24, 2025, we're implementing testing and optimization strategies for our deep research tool to ensure reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.

## Prompt
Create a comprehensive testing and optimization strategy for our deep research tool with these specifications:

1. Design unit and integration tests for Firecrawl MCP and OpenAI components
2. Implement performance benchmarking for different research scenarios
3. Create cost optimization strategies for API usage
4. Add monitoring and observability tools
5. Implement caching and memoization for frequently accessed data

## Expected Output
- A test suite covering core functionality with high test coverage
- Performance benchmarks for common research tasks
- Cost analysis and optimization recommendations
- Monitoring dashboard configuration
- Implementation of caching strategies with clear cache invalidation rules

## Vibe Coding Tips (June 2025)
- Use the new [`test-symphony`](https://github.com/ai-test-tools/test-symphony) framework for AI-specific testing patterns
- Implement [token usage tracking](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tokens) with the latest OpenAI SDKs to optimize costs
- Consider adding the new ["synthetic test corpus"](https://github.com/ai-test-tools/synthetic-corpus) approach for more reliable testing
- Use the latest [`api-shadow@2.0.0`](https://github.com/api-tools/api-shadow) techniques to test API interactions without actual calls
- Implement the new [predictive caching patterns](https://github.com/cache-strategies/predictive-cache) for research queries
